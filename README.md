# MOTHERSEA Source

One of the top 3 entries for GMC Jam #6, and the game that won me a license for GMS2, 'MOTHERSEA' is a cute little game about gathering fish and avoiding spike monsters. This was an excercise in many things, including color planning, making a game in a short time, and using shaders to actually direct gameplay. This repo contains the source code and a playable build of the game. All content made by Paul Cho unless otherwise stated.

Windows build can be found in 'program.zip' The application is named 'gamejam1.exe,' and must be extracted with the other files in order to work as intended.
